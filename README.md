# hot-math-games
Just like cool math games, but actual math games! This project was made for Hackrithmitic 2.

## Inspiration 💡
Students play Cool Math Games behind their teachers' backs because Cool Math Games are not considered educational. That's why we created Hot Math Games. Our games make math fun and engaging, and you would not have to be sneaky around your teacher because Hot Math Games are always going to be math related!

## What it does 🧩
Hot Math Games has a light and dark theme implementation to provide comfort to the eyes. The navigation bar gives quick access to the website. In the games section, there are several games for the user to enjoy. The user can fill out the contact form to send comments, concerns, or suggestions for a new math game to us. One game that we made is Swinging Multiples. This game uses a grappling hook to make learning about multiples fun.

## How we built it 🛠️
We made the website from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Swinging Multiples was made from Construct 3. We also used Formspree to handle the contact form.

## Challenges we ran into 💪
If we had more time, we could have made more games. We have so many ideas for the rest of the games, but for now we have to label them as Coming Soon due to the time restriction.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 👍
We're proud to make such a fun game. Swinging Multiples is so fun to play and I would totally play it during my free time.

## What we learned 🤝
We learned essential teamwork, communication, and time management skills. Working on a project is not easy, and it's even harder working through the internet. A technical skill that we learned was handling a contact form from the user. This was our first time using Formspree.

## What's next for Hot Math Games 😄
The obvious next step is to create more games. We already have cool games in mind, such as Prime Attack and Triple Tables! Then we can implement a search bar to make it easier to find the games. Backend can allow comments and user authentication.
